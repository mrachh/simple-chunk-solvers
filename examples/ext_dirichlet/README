If you run:

make -f ext_dir_daria.make

you will generate an executable file called "dirichletsolver".

It reads two kinds of data files:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
daria_geo.dat: 

The input lines are documented in the sample - lines shoudl specify:
1. iscat  0 lets you test for a known exact solution
          1 means true scattering problem
2. itot   1 means compute total field 
          0 means just scattered field
3. depth of slab
4. NMODE = number of fourier modes
5. Helmholtz coefficient
6. coefficient of sin( pi x)
7. coefficient of sin( pi 2 x)
...
   coefficient of sin( pi NMODE x)
incoming angle (not currently used - the code assumes normal incidence)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
targ.dat: (number of targets and their coordinates)

1. NTARG = number of targets
x1 y1
x2 y2
...
x_NTARG y_NTARG
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After execution, a new file is created called pot.m which contains the
complex-valued potential at the target points.
Another file is created called "bdrypts.m" which plots the geometry
for inspection.
